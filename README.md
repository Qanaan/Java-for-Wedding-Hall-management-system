Java for Wedding Hall management system


As the team leader in a four-person project, we created a web-based wedding hall reservation system to streamline and expedite reservations, payments, problem-solving, and service administration. The Hall Booking Management System is developed to simplify and optimize the hall reservation process for Hall Symphony Inc. The system serves four user roles:


✅Customers – Register, book halls, cancel reservations, and provide feedback.

✅Schedulers – Manage hall availability, add/edit hall details, and oversee scheduling.

✅Managers – Oversee sales reports, maintenance, and assign staff to resolve issues.

✅Administrators – Manage user accounts, block/delete users, and monitor bookings.

The goal of this project is to provide a workable, effective solution that would improve user experience and expedite processes.
